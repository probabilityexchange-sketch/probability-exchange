### 2. Legal & Regulatory: ⚠️ COMPLEX BUT MANAGEABLE
- **Primary Challenge**: US betting regulations vary by state and are evolving
- **Recommended Approach**: Start with "information aggregation" angle, build compliance framework early
- **Critical Path**: KYC/AML implementation required before betting functionality
- **Legal Investment**: Budget $300K-700K annually for compliance and legal

### 3. Market Opportunity: 🎯 HIGH POTENTIAL

- **Competitive Advantage**: ML-powered analysis + automated betting is differentiated
- **Revenue Model**: Multiple streams (commissions 2-5%, subscriptions, API access)
- **Target Market**: Estimated $50M+ annual addressable market

### 4. Resource Requirements: 💰 SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT
- **Development Team**: 8.5 FTE required ($2.5M-3.5M annually)
- **Total Investment**: $4M-6M for 12-month development cycle
- **Break-even Projection**: 18-24 months post-launch with $100K+ monthly revenue

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Approach (Recommended)
1. **Phase 1**: Research & Foundation (4 weeks) - $150K-200K
